## Educational Tutor Sub-App

This repository includes an AI-powered educational tutoring application located in [`apps/edu-tutor/`](./apps/edu-tutor/). The Educational Tutor provides a "hints-first" learning experience where students can:

- Ask educational questions and receive guided hints instead of direct answers
- Toggle between hints mode (1-2 guiding hints) and solution mode (complete explanations)  
- Experience real-time streaming responses for smooth interaction
- Export conversation history locally (no data is stored on servers)

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI API  
**Features**: Content moderation, rate limiting, mobile-responsive, accessible design  

The sub-app is completely self-contained and doesn't affect any existing portfolio content. See the [Educational Tutor README](./apps/edu-tutor/README.md) for detailed setup and deployment instructions.
