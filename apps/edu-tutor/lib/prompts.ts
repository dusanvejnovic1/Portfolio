Instructions (STRICT):
- Output NDJSON: one JSON object per line. Do NOT include any surrounding markdown, commentary, or prose.
- Each line must be a single JSON object (no arrays at top-level). Example per-line object for a full variant:
  {"type":"variant","variant": { ... }}
- You may also emit lightweight progress or summary objects like:
  {"type":"progress","value":"Generating variant 1 of N"}
  {"type":"assignment","assignment": {"id":"variant-1","title":"...","summary":"..."}}
- At the end, emit exactly one final JSON object with type 'full_set' containing the complete 'set' array:
  {"type":"full_set","set": [{...}, {...}, ...]}

Schema for each full variant object (inside variant or inside set):
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "scenario": "string",
  "objectives": ["string"],
  "steps": ["string"],
  "deliverables": ["string"],
  "rubric": [ { "name":"string","description":"string","weight":0.3, "levels":[{"score":5,"description":"Excellent"}] } ],
  "hints": ["string"],
  "stretchGoals": ["string"]
}

When given parameters, follow them precisely. If provided a count parameter, produce that many variants. Keep each variant focused, practical, and aligned with professional IT best practices. Do NOT fabricate URLs. If you can't produce the requested count, still emit what you have and finish with a 'full_set' object.
`

// Tightening NDJSON-specific size and verbosity constraints (STRICT):
// - Word limits: each full variant object MUST be <= 300 words total across all text fields.
// - Overall set limit: the entire 'set' should be compact; for count N, aim for <= N * 300 words.
// - Streaming previews (type: 'assignment') should include a short 'summary' field <= 40 words.
// - Field limits: objectives <= 5, steps <= 8, deliverables <= 5, hints <= 3, stretchGoals <= 2.
// - Rubric: keep at most 5 criteria; each level description <= 20 words; weights must sum to 1.0.
// - Use concise, bullet-like text. Avoid extended prose, examples, or long justifications inside fields.
// - If a field would be long (e.g., detailed steps), provide a compact outline and keep details minimal; clients can request an expanded version per-variant later.
// - If the model cannot respect these limits, truncate politely to meet them and note that the variant was truncated.
